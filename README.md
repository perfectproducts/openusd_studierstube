## What does “Studierstube” mean?

“[Studierstube](https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Studierstube)” literally means *study room* - a somewhat old-fashioned German word.

The group originally started in 2025 as a German-speaking study circle, and the name stuck.
Due to growing interest from non-German speakers, we switched to **English in 2026**, while keeping the spirit:
a focused, friendly space for learning together.
