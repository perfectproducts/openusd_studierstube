  IES files describe how light from a lamp is distributed in a room. This data is provided by many manufacturers so that lighting designers can realistically simulate how a project will look when a specific light source is used.

  3D artists also use this data to calculate their images more realistically. However, it is cumbersome to find the correct file using try and error, as the manufacturer does not necessarily include a visual example.

  For this reason this page was created. We have enriched existing IES collections with manufacturer data and have reached almost 200'000 data in the end. Using python we read the data, hashed the content as MD5 and assigned the data to the individual manufacturers. Thereby we eliminated duplicates. After this process, there was "only" 160'000 data left.
